# Mutton-chop-GetJeff
A simple (and silly) Spring boot application that includes a REST API, SQL database, and React front end.

To run: download the folders herein.  Import GetJeff as a Spring application to include these starters: H2, Rest Repositories, Spring Boot Devtools, Spring Web, and Spring Data JPA.  Import GetJeffGui as a react application.  In the terminal run npm install and then npm start.  The front end should be available at localhost:3000.  Run GetJeff as a spring boot application in your IDE and enjoy the absurdity of Pie Wars.
